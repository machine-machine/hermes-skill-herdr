# hermes-skill-herdr

Orchestrate a fleet of AI coding agents through **herdr** — the terminal
workspace manager (workspaces → tabs → panes) running on this machine.
Spawn agents, dispatch work, watch lifecycle state (idle/working/blocked),
unblock approval prompts, fan out and converge multi-agent work, and
manage agent integrations.

> Triggered when the user mentions herdr, the fleet, "spawn an agent",
> "what are my agents doing", panes/workspaces/worktrees, herdr
> integrations, or wants an agent to drive other coding agents
> (claude/codex/cursor/opencode/etc.) running in herdr.
>
> Also triggered when an intent arrives over a chat channel
> (Mattermost, Discord, Slack, etc.) and the right response is to
> spin up a parallel **herd** of codex (or mixed) workers to achieve
> the goal — understand the intent first, then fan out concurrent
> workers, converge results, and report back on the same channel.

## What is herdr?

herdr is a local CLI + headless server talking over a Unix-domain socket.
You orchestrate the fleet through the `herdr` CLI (which wraps the socket
API) or by speaking JSON to the socket directly. It is the host machine's
shared substrate for running more than one coding agent at a time, in
isolated worktrees, under a single visible window.

This skill teaches an agent how to:

| # | Workflow | When to use it |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Discover the fleet | "what's running?", "where is agent X?" |
| 2 | Know thyself (CRITICAL) | Before any send/run/close — avoid corrupting your own pane |
| 3 | Spawn an agent | Bring a new claude/codex/cursor/etc. online |
| 4 | Dispatch work | Send a prompt to an agent and submit it |
| 5 | Monitor & wait | Block until an agent reaches a target state |
| 6 | Unblock a stuck agent | Resolve approval/permission prompts |
| 7 | Fan-out → converge | Classic multi-agent parallel pattern |
| 8 | Notify the human | Local desktop notifications |
| 9 | Channel-driven intent → herd | Intent arrives on a chat channel, spin up a parallel herd |

## Install

### Quick install (one command)

```bash
# from a fresh agent environment
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machine-machine/hermes-skill-herdr/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This will clone the repo and symlink the skill into the right location
for both Claude (`~/.claude/skills/herdr/`) and Hermes (`~/.hermes/skills/herdr/`).

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/machine-machine/hermes-skill-herdr.git
cd hermes-skill-herdr

# Pick the target agent platform:
ln -s "$(pwd)/skill" ~/.hermes/skills/herdr
# or
ln -s "$(pwd)/skill" ~/.claude/skills/herdr
```

### Update

```bash
cd hermes-skill-herdr && git pull
```

The symlink stays valid, the skill is reloaded on next session.

## Versioning

This skill follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- **MAJOR** — breaking change to the workflow or command examples that an
  agent would follow
- **MINOR** — new workflow, new section, new command pattern added
- **PATCH** — typo fix, clarification, reference link fix, metadata update

The current version is declared in the `version` field of the YAML
frontmatter at the top of `skill/SKILL.md` and mirrored in
`CHANGELOG.md`.
